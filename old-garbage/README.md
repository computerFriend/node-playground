# PSA: Nothing in this folder is good
I'm just a packrat and can't throw anything away.  Everything in here is literal garbage (failed attempts, half-baked work, etc.)

I like saving old work as a sort of "time capsule"... if I'm ever having one of those moments where I question my own sanity and/or intelligence, I can look back at my old work & be like "... Well, at least I'm less stupid now than I was then." `#selfconfidenceFTW` `#moveOverDrDrew` `#justCallMeOprah`
